Here are the challenges the Group Faced

- With the Merge Conflicts: We faced many merge conflicts when we were doing the branch merges (for example, when we did feature/app into main). To make this good and resolve these conflicts we had 
to review and coordinate the conflicting files, such as like requirements.txt.
- Doing Networking in Docker: Trying to understand and configure a custom Docker network with the correct IPs was hard initially, had to ask Maider for help.
- Dependency Issues: When creating the setup of the Flask app, we found some compatibility issues between Flask and the versions we had installed.
- Managing branches: At the start, we had some confusion about how to structure branches properly. We decided to use a better branching model (main, feature/app, feature/docker).

It is important to note that while this repository may seem very clean, without issues, the main reason behind it is that we practiced on different repositories where we fixed the issues towards 
doing this final version (hence the name FINAL ;)

Lessons Learned
- Version Control: Once again, like in assignment 2, we got to learn and practice with Git commands, resolving merge conflicts, and ensuring a clean commit history. The importance of keeping the 
.gitignore file updated to prevent sensitive information from being pushed (which Maider specified the importance in class)
- Docker Networking: With setting up custom networks in Docker, we learnt how to manage container communication, avoid conflicts.
- Environment Variables: Using .env files to store sensitive information and understanding why they should be excluded from version control was interesting (which Maider also specified in class)

Once again, it is important to note that while this repository may show that certain people have done specific tasks, in previous repositorys we worked together, coded together, and worked on the 
assignment as a team, trying to solve each conflict and challenged faced
