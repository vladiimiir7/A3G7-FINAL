Importance of .gitignore for .env files.

This includes credential details and other configuration details and this is why the .env file holds secure data. 
The use of .env file in .gitignore list means that it is not tracked by git and one cannot commit or push it to the 
git repository. This means that if this file is placed in a repository anyone can get access to the systems or data 
that should be protected.

Risks of exposing credentials.
1. You minimize the chances of exposing secrets.
2. You keep credentials out of sight, while the repository is clean and can be easily shared with others.
