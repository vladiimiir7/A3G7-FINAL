- Subnet: 192.168.1.0/24
- Static IPs:
  - Flask App (app): 192.168.1.100
  - MySQL Database (db): 192.168.1.101

How Overlapping Subnets Could Impact the Host System

If the Docker network is the same as the host machine’s physical network, both the host and Docker containers may 
assign the same IP addresses to different devices or services. This would interfere with the communication between 
the host and the containers, and the host with other devices.

Also when the host and Docker uses the same IP range as the host system, it may not differentiate between packets 
destined to the containers and packets destined to other devices. For instance, if the host sends a request to 
192.168.1.100, then it will not know whether to forward the request to a Docker container or any physical device in 
the network.

DNS resolution in Docker.

Containers can find each other by their service names according to the docker-compose.yml file. For instance, Flask 
app can interact with the MySQL database through the use of the word ‘db’. Static IPs are good for debugging but 
otherwise are not very useful as services can always use names instead of IPs thanks to DNS resolution.
